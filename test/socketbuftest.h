// Revision 1.4.2.1  2003-06-23 19:58:42  alriddoch
//  2003-06-23 Al Riddoch <alriddoch@zepler.org>,
//     - Tweak Makefile.ams to make distcheck work.
//     - test/basicskstreamtest.h, test/childskstreamtest.h, test/skservertest.h,
//       test/socketbuftest.h: Include library headers correctly.

//
//     * Added in CVS logging variable so that changes show up in modified files
//       This will help keep changes made by worldforge in each file that is
//       changed as required by the GPL.
//
//     * Changed some parameter variables to have better meaning.
//       (ad -> address, etc.)
//
//     * Added some code into tcp_sk_stream::open so that it calls setLastError()
//       when the connection fails.
//
//     * Added some comments into skstream.h to better describe SOCKET_TYPE as
//       there can be some confusion between what it is actually for
//       (pointer/file descriptor/windows cludge of the socket) and the various
//       types of sockets (tcp, udp, raw, etc)
//
//     * Changed some more formatting for readability.
//
//     * Uncommented some commented out code in skstream.h so that the sync()
//       method returns 0 on the else, rather than not returning anything.
//
//     * Added some code into setBroadcast() so that setLastError() is called
//       if it fails to perform the getsocketopt().
//
//     * Modified the test/Makefile.am to remove the header files from the SOURCES
//       as the .h files do not seem to affect the build.
//
//     * Updated all the current test so that they use a socket instead of the
//       absolutely wrong stuff I was doing before.
//
//     * Added tests for tcp, udp, and raw skstreams child classes.
//
// Revision 1.3  2002/02/21 05:11:15  grimicus
// 2002-02-20 Dan Tomalesky <grim@xynesis.com>
//     * Added a new test case header for basic_socket_streams
//
//     * Made a mod to basic_socket_stream::setOutpeer(sockaddr_in&)
//       seemed to me it had an erroneous ! in the return
//
//     * Oh, and I reformatted skstream.h so its not so damn hard to look at
//
// Revision 1.2  2002/02/20 05:04:07  grimicus
// 2002-02-19 Grimicus <grim@xynesis.com>
//
//     * updated socketbuf(SOCKET_TYPE, unsigned, unsigned) to have variable
//       names in the declaration so it was a bit easier to look at. (and know
//       what the heck they were suppose to be for)
//
//     * Added some tests in for socketbuf.  Not very good ones but its a start
//
// Revision 1.1  2002/02/19 22:04:31  grimicus
// 2002-02-19 Grimicus <grim@xynesis.com>
//
//     * Added License header to skstream.h
//
//     * Added cppunit TestCase  classes in test/ and auto* support functionality
//
